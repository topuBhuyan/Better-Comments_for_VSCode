# Better-Comments_for_VSCode

The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code.
With this extension, you will be able to categorise your annotations into:

* **Alerts**
* **Queries**
- **TODOs**
+ **Highlights**
+ + **Commented out code can also be styled to make it clear the code shouldn't be there**
+ + **Any other comment styles you'd like can be specified in the settings**
 
```

/**
*       Arrays can have more than one dimension. For example, 
**      four arrays. Two arrays have two dimensions. Two arrays have three dimensions. 
*!      The first two declarations declare the length of each dimension, but don't initialize the
*?      values of the array. The second two declarations use an initializer to set the values of
*TODO   each element in the multidimensional array.
